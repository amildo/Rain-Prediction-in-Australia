# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia

This project is based on the *`IBM`* course in *`Coursera`* that i have attended.

The main tutor of this courser is Professor Saeed Aghabozorgi.

I am proud to be his countryman and we also graduated from the same university(**Isfahan University**).

In this project `Rain` is predicted with multiple ML Algorithms and some evaluation methods are used.

I hope it is useful for you :)
